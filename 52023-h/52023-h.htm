<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>The author of this paper has studied the
vegetable fibers used in fabricating objects
in the ethnological and archaeological collections
from the Indian tribes of the Mississippi
drainage and eastward, now in the
American Museum. The first task was to
identify them and view them against the
background of existing textile knowledge.
The present paper reports these identifications
and comments upon fiber samples
from collections in other museums.</p>

<p>The writing of this paper would have
been impossible without the generous and
whole-hearted co&ouml;peration of many institutions
and individuals. This assistance
has ranged from the furnishing of specimens
for determination, to advice as to
methods, classifications, and the supplying
of modern material for comparison. For
specimens of classified plants to be used
in the comparative work thanks are due
to The New York Botanical Garden in
Bronx Park, the Botanical Departments of
the University of Wisconsin, the University
of Oklahoma, and the University of
Georgia.</p>

<p>The standard histological microscopic
methods were used for the determination
of the fiber. Slides were made of both
cross-sections and longitudinal sections
and these were compared with previously
prepared and classified modern material.
When the specimen was too colored for
microscopic examination it was bleached
in a solution of Sodium perborate until
clear enough for study. In charred material,
when sufficient detail was preserved
for identification the fiber sample was
treated with Schultz Maceration solution,
washed, dried, and fortified by saturating
in a collodion solution. Occasionally, it
was found necessary to stain the material
and in this either Delafield&rsquo;s Haematoxylon
or Methylene Blue was used. In the differentiation
of certain species, it was found
necessary to make microscopic measurements
of the length and width of the cells,
but generally the shape, distribution,
medullation, and other constant characters
were sufficient for the identifications.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>MONOCOTYLEDONOUS SPECIES</h2>
</div>


<p>The fibers from monocotyledonous plants,
as identified, are listed here. Approximately
five hundred objects were sampled,
so the frequencies for the several species
should be given that denominator.</p>


<h3 class="left">ARECACEAE, Reichenb. (Palm Family)</h3>

<p>The palmetto (<i>Sabal palmetto</i>, Walt.)
seems to have been an article of commerce
as it was used by the Winnebago and the
Iroquois, north of its northern limit of distribution.
It was also used by the Cherokee.
The Winnebago used the fiber in the
production of stiff cords for their bags. In
three bags in the American Museum the
stiff cords are made from this material
(50-7531). For burden straps the Iroquois
used this fiber to produce stiff strong cords
which were covered with cotton or other
soft fiber (AMNH 50.1-1954). The Cherokee
used it in the manufacture of basketry
(AMNH 50.1-2141).</p>


<h3 class="left">BROMELIACEAE, J. St. Hil. (Pineapple
Family)</h3>

<p>This Florida moss (<i>Tillandsia usneoides</i>,
L.) was found in specimens from the
Southern States only. The Koasati and the
people who built certain mounds in Florida
used it frequently. A specimen in the
United States National Museum from the
Parish Mound, Number 2, in Florida, consisted
of a bunch of loose material. The
Koasati material is in the Museum of the
American Indian, Heye Foundation, and
is represented by fibers from a blanket and
threads on a spindle (1-8551).</p>


<h3 class="left">DRACAENACEAE, Link. (Yucca Family)</h3>

<p>Yucca (<i>Yucca arkansana</i>, Trelease) was
encountered in one specimen from the
Arkansas Bluff culture in a bundle of loose
fiber (MAIHF 11-7429).</p>

<p>Yucca (<i>Yucca filamentosa</i>, L.) was
found once in a heavy cord made by the
cave and shelter people of Ohio (OSHAM
332-42)</p>

<p><i>Nolina georgiana</i>, Michx., was found in
two specimens, a moccasin (OSHAM 332)
and a bristle-like fiber from the Spiro
Mound (2718-K, Trowbridge Collection).
It is possible that this plant may have been
used very frequently in objects from caves
and rock-shelters. It was not always convenient,
however, to examine complete
objects so that some occurrences of its
use may have been overlooked, especially
since these people commonly mixed several
fibers. In the specimen in question, for
example (OSHAM 332), <i>Nolina georgiana</i>
and <i>Eryngium yuccaefolium</i> were identified.
Similar combinations of fibers from widely
different plants have also been noted; frequently,
as in the example cited, a local
plant was mixed with one found at a great
distance.</p>


<h3 class="left">JUNIPERACEAE, Horan (Juniper Family)</h3>

<p>Red cedar (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>, L.)
was encountered in only one specimen, a
bag made by the Potawatomi Indians
(AMNH 50.1-7096).</p>


<h3 class="left">POACACEAE, R. Br. (Grass Family)</h3>

<p>The grass family was the most commonly
and widely used of any of the monocotyledonous
families.</p>

<p>Big blue stem grass (<i>Andropogon furcatus</i>,
Muhl.) was one of the major fibrous
plants used by the cave and rock-shelter
peoples of Ohio in the construction of
coarsely woven articles, such as rope and
moccasins. It was commonly used without
preliminary treatment, but was simply
twisted or braided into strands. The
specimens examined were from the Ohio
State Historical and Archaeological Museum.
A typical example of the use of this
fiber is in a woven moccasin (OSHAM
898-1).</p>

<p>Sweet grass (<i>Hierochloe odorata</i>, L.), to
be distinguished from sweet vernal grass,
was encountered only once in a bag made
by the Michigan Ottawa Indians (MAIHF
19-7125).</p>

<p>Canebrake (<i>Arundinaria tecta</i>, Muhl.)
was a common source of fiber for moccasins
and rope. It seems to have been utilized
by most of the prehistoric cave and rock-shelter
peoples within its range (OSHAM
332-27).</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">TYPHACEAE, J. St. Hil. (Cat-tail
Family)</h3>

<p>The cat-tail (<i>Typha latifolia</i>, L.) was
observed in a mat found in the caves of
Tennessee (USNM 132252).</p>


<h3 class="left">ZEA MAYS, L. (Indian Corn)</h3>

<p>Indian corn occurred only once. This
single occurrence has no real significance
as to the frequency of its use, for all specimens
in which it was obvious that corn was
the material used were not sampled. The
sample noted here was found in a knife
made by the Micmac Indians (McGU
H76). The material was a cornstalk which
had been subjected to considerable pressure
to force out the juice and pith to bring
the hardy flinty layers into juxtaposition.
It was then used as a wedge to fasten the
knife handle. It was extremely hard and
durable.</p>

<p>The above are the monocotyledons
encountered in this survey, in all some twenty-four
objects using this material. It should
be noted that these materials are readily
adaptable to use since they need very little
preparation and are frequently used entire.
Sometimes the fiber is removed from the
surrounding materials by simply letting
them ret. Yucca and <i>Tillandsia</i> are ordinarily
used entire. The grasses were used
as they were gathered, simply twisted or
braided. <i>Tillandsia</i> is the only plant of
this group which was used for the manufacture
of fabrics as in the blanket above
noted (p. <a href="#Page_7">7</a>). The specimen of cornstalk
was an exception and its preparation was
evidently for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>Palmetto fiber is especially adaptable.
At the base of the leaves, where they join
the main stem is a large mass of more or
less loose or loosely interwoven fibrous
material which needs only straightening to
be ready for use.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>DIOCOTYLEDONOUS SPECIES</h2>
</div>


<h3 class="left">ANONACEAE, D.&nbsp;C. (Custard-Apple
Family)</h3>

<p>The pawpaw (<i>Asimina triloba</i>, L.) seems
to have been universally used by all the
tribes who lived where it flourished. Its
use was apparently limited only by its distribution,
for it was encountered sixteen
times in the prehistoric material examined
from Kentucky, Arkansas, and Ohio, as
well as in historic objects made by the
Menomini and Wisconsin Potawatomi. In
the University of Wisconsin Museum is a
bunch of prepared fiber (16422) from the
caves of Kentucky. This fiber was commonly
used by the cave and rock-shelter
peoples of Arkansas for cords, mats, rope,
and in all coarsely woven materials. A
woven mat from Bushwick Cave is a fair
example (MAIHF 11-6243). The Ohio
cave and rock-shelter dwellers used the
pawpaw for coarse bags and fabrics, for
example, in a split bark bag (OSHAM 332-22).
In the Milwaukee Public Museum are
two bags in which this fiber was identified,
one, from the Menomini (4570) in which
only the weft is of pawpaw, and another
(23287) from the Wisconsin Potawatomi,
entirely composed of it.</p>


<h3 class="left">APOCYNACEAE, Lindl. (Dog-bane
Family)</h3>

<p>The genera <i>Apocynum</i> is represented by
both the species indigenous to the territory
surveyed, but as Indian hemp is one of
them, it was rather surprising how infrequently
they were encountered. Only ten
examples of its use were found.</p>

<p>This plant (<i>Apocynum androsaemifolium</i>,
L.) which is called dog-bane is so similar in
appearance and properties that it might
well have been and was used indiscriminately
with Indian hemp (<i>Apocynum cannabinum</i>,
L.). The species was found
three times in material examined. Its use
by the Nanticoke in the manufacture of
fish nets is demonstrated by a net (50.2-600)
in the American Museum. A burden
strap (50-7221) made from this fiber by
the Iroquois is also in the Museum collections.</p>

<p><i>Apocynum cannabinum</i> L., the so-called
Indian hemp, was found seven times and
of these is represented four times in the
archaeological cave and rock-shelter materials
examined. The Museum of the
American Indian, Heye Foundation, has
a bundle of prepared fibers (11-7384) found
at Allards Bluff, Arkansas. A dark colored
piece of fabric, attributed to the Hopewell
culture of Ohio, made in part from
this material (957) is in the collections of
the Ohio State Historical and Archaeological
Museum. Another piece of cloth
(1200) in the same museum is an Adena
culture example of the use of this fiber.
The Museum of the American Indian, Heye
Foundation, has a Sauk and Fox bag
(2-4694) made from this fiber. In the
American Museum a fish net (50.2-601)
made by the Nanticoke and an Iroquois
burden strap (50-7401) complete the catalogue
of objects in which this fiber occurs.
In many of the older specimens examined,
the fiber was crudely prepared before
twisting, but in the more recent Indian
material it is well broken down and fine,
so as to make small counts and even
threads or cords.</p>


<h3 class="left">ASCLEPIADACEAE, Lindl. (Milkweed
Family)</h3>

<p>The milkweed family is represented by
four species of <i>Asclepias</i>, namely, <i>tuberosa</i>,
<i>pulchra</i>, <i>incarnata</i>, and <i>syriaca</i>. These
fibers were used in the manufacture of fine
threads and cords. In both archaeological
and recent Indian material the fibers were
well prepared before use. In the archaeological
objects it is possible that the fibers
were collected in the spring, after retting by
the weather; in any event, they all show
that they have been freed to a large extent
of their cementitious materials and epidermis.</p>

<p>The highland milkweed (<i>Asclepias tuberosa</i>,
L.) was encountered twelve times
from all parts of its geographical range.
The cave dwellers of Arkansas used it, as
is exemplified by a bundle of knotted
fibers in the Museum of the American
Indian, Heye Foundation (11-6179). In
the Peabody Museum of Harvard University
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
is some textile material which accompanied
a knife found in an Ohio mound
(28328). The protohistoric Indians of
Massachusetts used the fiber to manufacture
textiles as may be seen in a piece of
plain cloth (A4127) and in a specimen of
twined cloth (A5478) in the same museum.
The Iroquois Indians employed it to make
fine threads for stringing wampum belts
as is shown by one (M1905) in the Archaeological
Museum of McGill University.
As stated above, all this material was
broken down to make comparatively fine,
smooth threads and cords.</p>

<p>The species, <i>Asclepias pulchra</i>, Ehrh.,
or swamp milkweed, is closely related to
<i>A. incarnata</i>, L. It was found in ten
specimens examined, but from only two
states, Ohio and Kentucky. In the University
of Kentucky Museum is a rope (Bh-15/V4),
made of this fiber. In the Ohio
State Historical and Archaeological Museum
are specimens of fabrics made from
it which are attributed to the Hopewell
culture. One of these, a piece of cloth
wrapped around a copper plate (283), also
contains <i>Urtica gracilis</i>.</p>

<p>The milkweed (<i>Asclepias incarnata</i>, L.)
was noted four times in Ohio archaeological
objects. In the Ohio State Historical and
Archaeological Museum is a two-strand
rope (899-20), one strand of which is made
from this fiber. This is a typical cave and
rock-shelter sample. Wrapped around a
Hopewell culture copper plate in the same
museum is a piece of fabric containing five
different fibers, among them <i>Asclepias incarnata</i>
(957).</p>

<p>The species <i>Asclepias syriaca</i>, L., seems
to be the most widely distributed geographically
of any used by the Indians
surveyed in this paper. It was found seventeen
times in material from all sections and
many tribes.</p>

<p>In this Museum were observed the following
objects in which this fiber was used
in whole or in combination with other
fiber: a Sauk and Fox bag (50-4886); a
Delaware drum string (50.1-1609); a Delaware
burden strap (50-7244); a Matchapunga
fish net (50.1-9911); and a cord
used, for wrapping on a spear (50.1-7475),
Micmac. In the Museum of the American
Indian, Heye Foundation, is a Kickapoo
ball of string (2-5294) made of this fiber.
In an Iroquois wampum belt (M1913) in
the Archaeological Museum of McGill
University, the beads are strung on cords
made from this fiber. An Iroquois burden
strap (AE 360) in the Rochester Museum of
Arts and Sciences is composed of this
fiber. Fiber of this species was also used
by the prehistoric cave and rock-shelter
people of Ohio as is shown by a fish net
(OSHAM 332-23) in the Ohio State Historical
and Archaeological Museum.</p>


<h3 class="left">BETULACEAE, Agardh. (Birch Family)</h3>

<p>The paper birch (<i>Betula papyrifera</i>,
Marsh.) was encountered in one specimen
(AMNH 50.2-1792). The bark was untreated,
simply twisted into a cord. In a
specimen of Iroquois horsehair embroidery
(McGU H49) the bark had received no
preliminary treatment, but was used in the
raw state.</p>


<h3 class="left">CANNABINACEAE, Lindl. (Hop Family)</h3>

<p>This introduced plant, hemp (<i>Cannabis
sativa</i>, L.), was found in four specimens,
evidently made in post-Columbian times
as the plant is not indigenous to the Western
Hemisphere, but was introduced by the
colonists at a very early date. It was
found in a bag (MPM 28116) made by the
Wisconsin Potawatomi Indians. A bowstring
on an Algonkin bow (AMNH 50.2-4221A)
is made from this fiber as are also
portions of an Oneida burden strap (AMNH
50.1-1800).</p>


<h3 class="left">DAPHNACEAE (Mezereon Family)</h3>

<p>This moose or leatherwood fiber (<i>Dirca
palustris</i>, L.) was encountered eleven times
in as widely separated states as Arkansas
and Wisconsin. It was used both in the
raw state, as strips twisted into cord, and
as treated fiber in finer cords and threads.
A prehistoric mat made by the inhabitants
of Bushwick Cave, Arkansas, is composed
of this material (MAIHF 19-4635). Cloth
of the Adena culture made, in part, from
this bast fiber (1200) is in the Ohio State
Historical and Archaeological Museum.
In the Milwaukee Public Museum is a
Wisconsin Potawatomi bag (23447) in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
which the weft is nicely prepared fiber from
this plant. In the collections of this
Museum is a Winnebago bag (50-784D)
woven with two kinds of cord; light colored
cord of <i>Dirca palustris</i> and dark colored
cord of <i>Tilia americana</i>.</p>


<h3 class="left">JUGLANDACEAE, Lindl. (Walnut Family)</h3>

<p>The bast from the black walnut (<i>Juglans
nigra</i>, L.) was encountered twice in burden
straps from the Iroquois (Museum of the
American Indian, Heye Foundation).
These fibers had apparently been previously
treated, both chemically and mechanically.
They were probably boiled in
ashes, pounded, and then straightened so
as to make them usable in twisting cord
and thread. One such specimen in the
above Museum carries the catalogue number
16-5208.</p>


<h3 class="left">LINACEAE, Dumort. (Flax Family)</h3>

<p>Common flax (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i>, L.)
is another example of introduced fibers
used by the Indians in post-Columbian
times. The fiber was probably secured in
trade. It was found in five specimens
made by the Winnebago, Potawatomi,
Michigan, Ottawa, and Delaware Indians.
In the Milwaukee Public Museum is a bag
(14619), made by the Winnebago and
composed entirely of flax cords. In a
Delaware burden strap (50-7191) in this
Museum the fine cords are linen, but the
coarse cords are milkweed, <i>Asclepias syriaca</i>.
In the Archaeological Museum of McGill
University is a wampum belt (M5932),
the beads of which are strung on a commercial
linen thread.</p>


<h3 class="left">MALVACEAE, Neck. (Mallow Family)</h3>

<p>As was to be expected, cotton (<i>Gossypium
herbaceum</i>, L.) became the most commonly
and universally used of any of the
fibers after it was introduced east of the
Mississippi River. No specimen was
encountered in the prehistoric material,
but after its introduction and sale by
traders it was the most commonly used
fiber. It does not seem advisable to discuss
these uses in detail, suffice it to say
that it served all purposes for which string
and thread are utilized.</p>


<h3 class="left">SALICACEAE, Lindl. (Willow Family)</h3>

<p>Black willow (<i>Salix nigra</i>, Marsh.). This
species of black willow was used by the
Menomini, Winnebago, Michigan Ottawa,
and Ojibway Indians in the manufacture
of bags, pouches, fish nets, and cord. A
Menomini bag (MAIHF 8-1136) and a
similar Winnebago bag (AMNH 50.1-903)
contain black willow fiber. A Micmac
fish spear (AMNH 50-4754) is wrapped
with black willow twine. In the preparation
of black willow fiber the bark was
obviously stripped from the tree. Then
the inner white bast tissue was removed
and boiled in wood ashes; finally, this
bast was pounded and rubbed to remove all
the cementitious materials and loosen the
fibers so they could be arranged more or
less parallel to each other for twisting or
spinning. In none of the specimens examined
were crude strips of the inner bark
used without preliminary treatment.</p>


<h3 class="left">TILIACEAE, Juss. (Basswood Family)</h3>

<p>The bast layer from the basswood (<i>Tilia
americana</i>, L.) seems to have been the fiber
most commonly and universally used by
the Eastern Indians, for it was encountered
fifty-two times, in all areas from which
specimens were obtained, with the exception
of the extreme south. It was utilized
for nearly all purposes, from the manufacture
of bags to textiles. In the Milwaukee
Public Museum is a Menomini
bag (4586) made from the <i>Tilia</i> bast, carefully
and thoroughly prepared to remove
the gums and render the fibers parallel
and capable of being spun into good yarn.
A Potawatomi bag in this Museum (50.1-7091)
is made from the same material.
In the Museum of the American Indian,
Heye Foundation, is a bag made by the
Sauk and Fox (2-4966). In the Peabody
Museum of Harvard University is a twilled
woven garment (A5479B) made by the
protohistoric Indians of Massachusetts.
An Iroquois burden strap (AE 2963) in the
Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences is
woven of threads from prepared fibers from
this tree. In the Ohio State Historical and
Archaeological Museum is a prehistoric
fabric (957) containing <i>Tilia</i> and three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
other species of fiber. Hopewell mound
and rock-shelter specimens in the same
museum show the use of <i>Tilia</i>.</p>

<p>The above gives a general picture of basswood
fiber usage. It was found in an untreated
state, merely cut into strips, as
well as thoroughly treated and spun into
comparatively fine threads.</p>


<h3 class="left">ULMACEAE, Mirbel. (Elm Family)</h3>

<p>The slippery elm (<i>Ulmus fulva</i>, Michx.)
was found three times. Once, in a burden
strap made by the Iroquois Indians
(AMNH 50-6680) in which the fibers had
received some preliminary treatment to
soften them and remove much of the natural
gum. Two other specimens, both
rather coarsely woven fabrics from mounds
of the Hopewell culture (OSHAM 283 and
125) were in the Ohio State Historical and
Archaeological Museum.</p>

<p>The American elm (<i>Ulmus americana</i>,
L.) was encountered only once in an Iroquois
burden strap (MAIHF 19-4550).
The fiber had received some preliminary
treatment and differed decidedly from
<i>Ulmus fulva</i> in the shape of the cells, in
cross-section, and the residual amount of
amorphous material.</p>


<h3 class="left">UMBELLIFERAE</h3>

<p>The <i>eryngium</i> (<i>Eryngium yuccaefolium</i>,
Michx.) was commonly used by the prehistoric
tribes of the area in which it occurs.
It was found fifty-five times in material
from the caves and rock-shelters of Arkansas,
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio.
Its parallel veined long leaves lend themselves
to all uses as readily as the yuccas
of the south and west. It is easily shredded
or it can be used entire with equal facility.
The stem contains a very strong bast fiber
which was also utilized. It does not seem
to have been utilized by the historic Indians,
as it was not encountered outside of
the above cultures. Whatever, if any,
treatment it received before usage was very
slight and consisted apparently of shredding,
with no chemical treatment, as no
fine threads or cords were found. A sandal
from the Kentucky cave culture is made
from this plant by utilizing the leaf, as in
the Southwest. A cord from a reed mat
found in the Tennessee caves (USNM
132252) is made from this material. The
cord was used for tying reeds (<i>Typha latifolia</i>,
L.) together. The Museum of the
American Indian, Heye Foundation, contains
many specimens taken from the caves
and rock-shelters of Arkansas. Among
these is a bag (11-7315) from Allards
Bluff, made of this material.</p>

<p>This plant was frequently encountered
in collections from the Hopewell and the
rock-shelter cultures of Ohio, in the State
Museum at Columbus; as, braided work
(957), and cloth from a burial (854). These
objects are believed to be typical, but the
same plant was used in all classes of cordage
and textiles found in collections representing
these cultures.</p>


<h3 class="left">URTICACEAE, Reichenb. (Nettle Family)</h3>

<p>The nettle family is represented by three
genera, <i>Boehmeria</i>, <i>Urtica</i>, and <i>Laportea</i>.
Specimens of these three were encountered
forty-eight times, so it seems to have been
one of the most important families as a
source of fibrous materials. The tissues
were, almost without exception, treated
before use.</p>

<p>The stingless nettle (<i>Boehmeria cylindrica</i>,
L.) was used by practically all the
Indian tribes covered by this survey. It
was invariably more or less treated, with
the possible exception of some twisted
strands from the Bushwick Cave of Arkansas
(MAIHF 19-4632). This cord appears
to have been made by simply peeling
the bark from the plant and twisting it.
The Delaware used the same fiber in a
wampum string (AMNH 50.1-1579), also
in a burden strap (AMNH 50.1-1592).
A Cherokee string used in a feather charm
occurs in the collection of the Museum of
the American Indian, Heye Foundation.
The handle of a Micmac curved knife
(McGU H76) is fastened to the blade by
wrapping with cord of this fiber. In the
same museum there are two Iroquois
wampum belts in which the strings for the
beads are made from <i>Boehmeria</i> fiber.
In the American Museum are two specimens
of cord, one on a Micmac fish spear
(50.1-7475) and the other the string to an
Ojibway bow (50-6874A).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
It is evident that raw <i>Boehmeria</i> fiber,
properly treated, produces especially fine,
soft, and strong material. It is easily distinguished
from the fibers of the other
members of the family by its smaller size,
the shape of the cells, and their distribution
when seen in cross-section. Both the
<i>Urtica</i> and <i>Laportea</i> fibers are coarser and
the ratio of length to width of the fiber is
much greater. The lumen in all three is
longer one way than the other, but is much
more open in <i>Boehmeria cylindrica</i> than
the other species.</p>

<p>The slender nettle (<i>Urtica gracilis</i>, Ait.)
seems to have been a favorite source for all
peoples from prehistoric to modern Indians.
Its use extended from New England to
Wisconsin. It was usually processed before
use, except among some of the prehistoric
peoples where it was merely twisted into
cord. A bag from the caves of Tennessee
(USNM 132255) is made from this fiber
which has had some preliminary treatment.
A modern Sauk and Fox bag (MAIHF
2-7911) shows complete preliminary processing.
Some string in the Peabody Museum
of Harvard University (A4109), is
made from this plant; this is protohistoric
material. The Hopewell culture of Ohio
is represented by twelve specimens using
this fiber, all of which show some preliminary
treatment. A sample of cloth from a
copper plate is representative (OSHAM
283). The cave and rock-shelter cultures
of Ohio are represented, but here the fiber
seems to have received little, if any, preliminary
treatment prior to use (OSHAM
332-42).</p>

<p>The woods nettle (<i>Laportea canadensis</i>,
L.) was most widely used of all of the <i>Urticaceae</i>,
both before and after treatment.
It was used by the Sauk and Fox for bags,
after it had received thorough treatment.
In the Milwaukee Public Museum is a bag
(30260) made of this material, thoroughly
treated before being twisted into fine cord.
A string used for tying a spear point to a
shaft is in the Ojibway collection of the
American Museum (50-4748). The Iroquois
used it to make burden straps
(MAIHF 19-8895). Braided cloth from
prehistoric Kentucky is represented by a
specimen (56795) in the Peabody Museum
of Harvard University. The cave
culture of Tennessee is represented in the
United States National Museum by a shirt
(132254) made from this fiber. The Hopewell
culture of Ohio is well represented by
fabrics in the Ohio State Historical and
Archaeological Museum (957, is an example).
The cave and rock-shelter culture
of the same state employed this fiber
to make twined cords as is exemplified by
a cord (OSHAM 332-34). The cave and
rock-shelter cultures of Arkansas used it
for the manufacture of twisted cords as
may be seen in a specimen (19-4630) in
the Museum of the American Indian, Heye
Foundation.</p>

<p>A comparison of materials in prehistoric
collections reveals an excess of animal
materials in the artifacts from Spiro
Mound. One gets the impression that in
Spiro textiles strings of vegetable fiber are
usually surfaced with hair or other animal
materials to increase the softness of
the product. This may account for the
almost exclusive use of canebrake and
pawpaw, both relatively coarse fibers used
without preliminary treatment. A striking
contrast is between the slipshod way of
making string and the highly precise fine
techniques of covering it with hair and
feathers.</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>SUMMARY</h2>
</div>


<p>This survey makes no pretension of
being complete, but it is an adequate
sampling of the fibers utilized by the
Eastern Indians and illustrates their resourcefulness
in exploiting the raw materials
at hand. It is noticeable that they
used a great variety of plants and that one
of the determining properties or qualifications
was the local abundance of a plant.
There seems to have been a tendency to
use the monocotyledonous plants and the
bast from the trees for coarser work and
the diocotyledonous herbaceous plants for
the manufacture of finer cords and threads.</p>

<p>Several general points of interest are apparent
from the comparative study of these
prehistoric and historic plant materials.</p>

<p>1. The plant fibers used by the prehistoric
people were rarely if ever treated
before utilization, while among the modern
Indians a high degree of skill has been attained
in the preparation of the fibers before
spinning.</p>

<p>2. There seems to have been some commercial
interchange between the Northern
and the Southern tribes, both in historic
and prehistoric times. The occurrence of
palmetto fibers in modern Mohawk and
Potawatomi collections and the use of
<i>Nolina</i> by the cave and rock-shelter people
of Ohio, shows commerce.</p>

<p>3. It seems that most, if not all, of the
materials utilized were wild plants for
there was no discoverable evidence of the
cultivation of these plants. Such evidence
would be far from obvious since cultivation
does not seem to improve the fibers in
textile plants.</p>

<p>4. Among the prehistoric peoples the
purposeful mixing of fibers was the rule.
This is especially notable in the collections
from Ohio and Arkansas. These mixtures
of fibers occur both in the same strand and
in the two-ply cords. It is not apparent
why the fibers from different plants
were mixed, but the combinations seem intentional,
as nettle and milkweed, blue stem
grass and pawpaw, nettle and yucca, basswood
and nettle, and pawpaw and yucca.
Yet, such intentional mixtures were rarely
encountered in the historic collections examined.</p>

<p>5. It is apparent that the prehistoric
peoples used such fibers as were adapted
to their immediate purpose without previous
treatment. They were stripped from
the plant and twisted at once. This seems
to account for the dominance of monocotyledonous
fibers in prehistoric collections.
The historic Indians, on the other hand,
used a greater variety of species of fiber
plants because they were able to prepare
them properly before using. The determining
factors seem to have been
strength, fineness of fiber, and abundance
of supply.</p>

<p>All the above observations are consistent
with the assumption of a steady advance
in textile skill and knowledge from prehistoric
time to the present.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
